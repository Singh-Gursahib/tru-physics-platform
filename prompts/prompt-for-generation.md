Simulation 4: Conservation of Momentum (Explosion from Rest)
Source: Slide 34
Context: This is a classic example of the law of conservation of momentum. Since the two ice skaters start at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. The forces they exert on each other are internal, so the total final momentum must also be zero. This means their individual momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
Exact Question: "Two ice skaters... Sandra and David... stand facing each other on frictionless ice... After the push, Sandra moves off at a speed of 2.2 m/s. What is David's speed?"
Data:
Mass of Sandra (m_S): 45 kg
Mass of David (m_D): 80 kg
Initial velocities: v_Si = 0 m/s, v_Di = 0 m/s
Final speed of Sandra (v_Sf): 2.2 m/s
Best Approach for Simulation:
The simulation should begin with two figures (skaters) at rest in the center of a frictionless ice rink, with a "Total Momentum" display reading zero. Upon clicking a "Push Off" button, the simulation calculates David's final velocity using momentum conservation (m_Sv_Sf + m_Dv_Df = 0). The animation then shows the skaters moving apart in opposite directions. The lighter skater (Sandra) should visibly move faster than the heavier skater (David). The most effective feature would be to display momentum vectors for each skater after they push off; the vectors should be drawn to scale, pointing in opposite directions but having the same length, reinforcing that their momenta are equal and opposite, and the "Total Momentum" display remains at zero.

TRY TO SPEND TIME AND MAKE IT BEAUTIFUL IMPLEMENATION, NOT JUST SIMPLE!

Its not good, I wanted something better! Also text on simulation itself is so thick that I am unable to read it! PLS FIX IT! Do a btter implementation in HTML directly! Spend time, plan and create beautiful Simulation
