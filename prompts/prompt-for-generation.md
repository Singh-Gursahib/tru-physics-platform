This is a Physics based Course project which includes creatting simulations for course content.Pls follow these steps. 

New simulation request:
Course named "PHYS1100 - Fundamentals of Physics 1" 
New Topic: "Ch 6.1_6.2_6.5_Circular Motion and Gravitation"

Question: 
"""
Planet X has free-fall acceleration 8 m/s2 at the surface.
Planet Y has twice the mass and twice the radius of
planet X. On Planet Y value of g is?

• g = 2 m/s2
• g = 4 m/s2
• g = 8 m/s2
• g = 16 m/s2
• g = 32 m/s2
