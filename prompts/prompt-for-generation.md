Simulation 1: Reading Wave Graphs
Context: This problem tests the ability to interpret two fundamental types of wave graphs. The first is a "snapshot graph" (y vs. x), which freezes the wave in time and shows its shape in space, from which the wavelength (λ) can be determined. The second is a "history graph" (y vs. t), which tracks the oscillation of a single point in space over time, from which the period (T) can be determined. The wave speed (v) is then found using the fundamental wave equation, v = λ / T.
Exact Question: "A snapshot and a history graph for a sinusoidal wave on a string appear as follows: What is the speed of the wave?"
Data:
Snapshot Graph (y vs. x): One full cycle completes in 0.6 meters (e.g., from a peak at 0.3 m to the next peak at 0.9 m). So, Wavelength (λ) = 0.6 m.
History Graph (y vs. t): One full cycle completes in 0.2 seconds (e.g., from a peak at 0.1 s to the next peak at 0.3 s). So, Period (T) = 0.2 s.
Best Approach for Simulation:
The best approach is an interactive dual-graph simulation. It would display an animated travelling wave across the top of the screen. Below it, two static graphs would be generated: the "Snapshot" and "History" graphs from the problem. The user could pause the animation to see that the snapshot graph is a literal freeze-frame of the animated wave. They could also click on a single point in the animated wave to see how its up-and-down motion over time generates the history graph. Sliders to control Amplitude, Wavelength, and Period for the animated wave would allow the user to see how changes in these parameters affect both graphs in real-time, solidifying the connection between them and the final calculated wave speed.
