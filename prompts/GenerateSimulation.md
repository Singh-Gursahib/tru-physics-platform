Add code for this simulation:

"""
Create a single self-contained HTML file using **p5.js** (or **Three.js** if needed) to visualize and simulate the following scenario:

[INSERT QUESTION OR PHYSICAL SCENARIO HERE”]

TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE QUESTION AIMS TO TEACH STUDENTS (Undergrad level students) AND PLAN THE SIMULATION WITH THAT GOAL!

Compute and display all relevant physics quantities (e.g., net force, applied force, acceleration, friction, velocity, stopping distance, etc.), and create a smooth, realistic **animation** showing the system in motion.

Use a **clean, centered layout (800 × 600 canvas)** similar to other simulations.  
On the **left**, include a **dark-teal sidebar** styled using **Tailwind CSS** with **sliders and controls** for tweakable parameters (mass, friction, applied force, velocity, etc. as per the question/use case). Also include the formulas and steps/calculations here to solve a problem(if required).  
On the **bottom or right**, display the **simulation window** with a **light theme background**, clear vector arrows, labels, and animated visuals.

Make the simulation **interactive and visually appealing**:
- Add real-time value updates (for all key quantities) in an info panel at left.
- Provide **keyboard controls** (LEFT/RIGHT arrows to apply force, SPACE to stop) (if required).
- Include **toggle buttons** for special/different cases (e.g., “no friction,” “zero net force,” “high friction” and soo on as per the question and use case of the simulation).
- Use smooth easing and motion transitions to make it feel physically realistic if required.
- Ensure all text and visuals are dynamically updated as parameters change.

Everything (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) must be contained in **one HTML file**, runnable directly in any browser without external dependencies.  
If needed, refer to existing project structure for inspiration:
**public/Data/Courses/PHYS-1001-Intro-Mechanics/Topics/Forces-and-Friction/Simulations/friction-demo.html**

Think about implementation first and Make sure everything works! 

Now Read and follow follow this next: "prompts/SIMULATION_ADD_GUIDE.md" to add that to the directory structure/platform.
